# MusicLabeler

I just needed a simple tool to apply a few ID3 tags to some MP3 files.

## How it Works

Place your MP3 files in a directory (let's say ```C:\Music```).  Name each of the files with a name following the pattern ```[artist] - [title] (remix)```, i.e. ```DJ Dan - Needle Damage (Carl Cox Remix)```.  Run the MusicLabeler app.  It will parse the name and set the AlbumArtist and Title ID3 tags accordingly.To delete
